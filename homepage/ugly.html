            <Lp>As a Computer Science and Mathematics student, I’m interested in learning new technologies and applying them to solution-oriented projects. Though I'm passionate about Software Engineering, I love to get involved in as many different areas of a project as I can! When I'm not on a screen, I'm either out with my dog, gaming or playing basketball. </Lp>
